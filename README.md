# nodejs

## my nodejs stack of samples

This repository is based on the assumption that nodejs technology is sitting at the bottom of every Web Client stack I will concerned about for years to come.

Every CSS, JavaScript (client-side) and (X)HTML sample I have every wrote should be migrated to this repository. (That was not a note for you but for myself.) Most of my Web Client/App samples are on [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/rasx).

Each folder of this repository represents a subject matter of self study. To start working with this repository, take a look at the [`http-server`](./http-server) sample.

## the CDN behind these samples

These samples should be organized behind one (or maybe two [free/open-source CDN sources](https://www.maxcdn.com/blog/free-open-source-cdns/)) for the sake of simplicity and clarity.

The first CDN of choice is “[Microsoft Ajax Content Delivery Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/ajax/cdn/overview)” as it is deliberately limited to the most ridiculously popular JavaScript/CSS libraries.
