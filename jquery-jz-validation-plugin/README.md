# jQuery: Jörn Zaefferer’s validation plug-in with bootstrap layout

This sample is on [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/rasx/pen/lIyFn).

As an alternative to using a CDN, we can turn to the node package manager:

```bash
npm install --save jquery-validation
```

This will install Jörn Zaefferer’s [package](https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation).
