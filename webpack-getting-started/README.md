# webpack: “Getting Started”

The sample follows [“Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)” at webpack.js.org.

When the `webpack-getting-started/` [folder](../webpack-getting-started) was empty, these were the setup steps:

```bash
mkdir webpack-demo
cd webpack-demo
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
touch index.html
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.js
```
