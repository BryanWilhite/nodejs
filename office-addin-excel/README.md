I was unable to get the Angular and Vue add-ins working. The issue might be related to trying to connect to `localhost` and HTTPS/port issues. In addition to these concerns, I am concerned that the debugging experience might be impossible with these JavaScript-based add-ins [without Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-and-debug-office-add-ins-in-visual-studio).
