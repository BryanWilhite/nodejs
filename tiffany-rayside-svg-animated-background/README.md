# Tiffany Rayside ([@tmrDevelops](https://twitter.com/tmrDevelops)): SVG: Animated Background Pattern

This sample is a study of a popular [Tiffany Rayside CodePen](https://codepen.io/tmrDevelops/pen/eNXoGx), featuring SVG animation via `window.requestAnimationFrame()`.

## Notes for Tiffany

I wrapped [your JavaScript](./index.js) in the `window.onload` event handler. I do plan to add a TypeScript-based version of this sample that will run side-by-side next to your code. My intent is to preserve your original intent while studying your techniques in the context of Node.js.
