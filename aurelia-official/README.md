# aurelia ‘official’

Rob Eisenberg’s “[Contact Manager Tutorial](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/contact-manager-tutorial/1)” is the introductory, production-ready sample project of the official documentation. The ideal here is to update this project as the official documentation updates.

As of this writing, this tutorial runs with [the latest Chocolatey Node.js® package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs) or on bash it requires node versions >= 6.x (run `node --version`):

```bash

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```

Note that Ubuntu bash on Windows may not run this tutorial correctly (it has an Aurelia CLI issue similar to [the one for Angular](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/1522)).

The tutorial tells us that we need the [Aurelia CLI](https://github.com/aurelia/cli) (command-line interface):

```bash
sudo npm install aurelia-cli -g
```

```powershell
npm install aurelia-cli -g
```

After this is installed (and it might take _many_ minutes), we run the following from the root folder of this repository:

```bash
au new
```

All of the prompts are answered with the defaults with the exception that the target folder is `[aurelia-official](../aurelia-official)` and default setup, `Default TypeScript`. Note that the `[.gitignore](../.gitignore)` file of this repository is set up to ignore the `node_modules` folder generated by this command (which will be about 128MB).

Following the official tutorial, we need to download some “Required Assets” to the root folder of this repository:

```bash

wget http://aurelia.io/downloads/contact-manager-assets.zip --content-disposition --no-check-certificate -O ./aurelia-official/src/tmp.zip

```

We then “Copy all of these files to the `src` folder of your project. TypeScript users should also rename the file extensions from `.js` to `.ts`.” This tutorial (from a TypeScript-biased point of view) will recommend that [the Typings CLI utility](https://github.com/typings/typings) be available:

```bash
sudo npm install typings --g
```

```powershell
npm install typings --g
```

Additionally, you may need to install `[jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint)` (in case Visual Studio complains):

```bash
sudo npm install jshint -g
```

```powershell
npm install jshint -g
```

And, to run the site, use the Aurelia CLI:

```bash
au run --watch
```

This tutorial does an excellent job at introducing these concepts:

* the [Aurelia CLI](https://github.com/aurelia/cli)
* `App.configureRouter()`
* default route (`route: ''`)
* view template `<require />` and `<router-view />` elements
* the purposes of the `aurelia.json` file
* hyphen-camel-case convention (`contact-list` and `ContactList`)
* the `inject` decorator
* the Aurelia [Component Lifecycle](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/creating-components/3)
* the `$parent` value in view templates
* the `route-href` custom attribute
* the reason why we need to return `true` from a click handler
* “additional life-cycle methods for _routed components_” (e.g. `activate()` and `canDeactivate()`)
* route parameters
* `click.delegate()`, `value.bind` and `disabled.bind`.
* the [Typings CLI](https://github.com/typings/typings)
* the `noView()` decorator
* globalized view resources ([global resources](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/templating/latest/templating-html-behaviors-introduction/5)) in `resources/index.ts`
