# aurelia ‘official’

Rob Eisenberg’s “[Contact Manager Tutorial](http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/contact-manager-tutorial/1)” is the introductory, production-ready sample project of the official documentation. The ideal here is to update this project as the official documentation updates.

As of this writing, this tutorial cannot run with the Chocolatey Node.js® packages as it requires node versions >= 6.x (run `node --version`). This encourages me to work with this entirely from bash:

```bash

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```

The tutorial tells us that we need the [Aurelia CLI](https://github.com/aurelia/cli) (command-line interface):

```bash

sudo npm install aurelia-cli -g

```

After this is installed (and it might take _many_ minutes), we run the following from the root folder of this repository:

```bash

au new

```

All of the prompts are answered with the defaults with the exception that the target folder is `[aurelia-official](../aurelia-official)` and default setup `Default TypeScript`. Note that the `[.gitignore](../.gitignore)` file of this repository is set up to ignore the `node_modules` folder generated by this command (which will be about 128MB).
