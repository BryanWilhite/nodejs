## mustache.js

This sample is now using mustache.js [[GitHub]](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js):

```bash
npm install --save mustache
npm install --save-dev @types/mustache
npm run cp
```

It must be mentioned that the use of mustache.js is considered a “gateway drug” into vue.js [[GitHub]](https://github.com/vuejs/vue). Also, a brief investigation of [vash](https://github.com/kirbysayshi/vash) found no reference to the use of templates in `<script />` tags. A code-only approach to templates is definitely in the `_.template` [function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#template) of lodash.
