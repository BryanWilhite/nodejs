# Markdown-driving web sites with 11ty

[11ty](https://11ty.io) is the current static-site generator solution of the Songhay Studio. These are the main reasons why 11ty is the current choice:

- 11ty uses several templating engines, `liquid` [[docs](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid)] being the default.
- 11ty is a child of Node.js: JavaScript is the underlying language and whatever else lies under Node.js—no Ruby, no Go.

## installation

The installation depends on `npx` [[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)] being installed globally (`npm i -g npx@latest`).

With respect to the `package.json` [file](./package.json), run:

```console
npm i --save-dev eleventy
```
