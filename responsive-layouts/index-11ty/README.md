# eleventy ([11ty.dev](https://11ty.dev)) index layout

This sample documents the core ingredients needed to cook up a production Web site based on the [Publications Index](http://songhayblog.azurewebsites.net/entry/2020-12-24-songhay-publications-and-the-concept-of-the-index) data of my Studio.

The Publications Index indexes a _Presentation_. To mark this, we start with the `presentation/` folder. We place the Publications Index file, `index.json`, in the conventional, eleventy `_data/` [folder](./index-11ty/presentation/_data) under the Presentation folder.

In the bash shell, we can generate the conventional eleventy files (with respect to the `index-11ty/` [folder](./index-11ty)):

```bash
touch \
    presentation/_data/settings.json \
    presentation/.eleventyignore \
    presentation/.eleventy.js \
    presentation/index.html
```

All of these files (except for `presentation/index.html`) will be filled out based on previous work with eleventy in this Studio and ongoing research. The `presentation/index.html` file is copied from the `responsive-layouts/index/` [folder](./index) to be modified for eleventy static file generation.

## choosing liquid templates in eleventy

The `presentation/index.html` file can be decomposed into liquid [snippets](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/88186566-tips-for-using-snippets-in-your-shopify-theme) with the conventional `_includes` folder:

```bash
touch \
    presentation/_includes/head.liquid \
    presentation/_includes/body-svg.liquid \
    presentation/_includes/body-header.liquid \
    presentation/_includes/body-main-section.liquid \
    presentation/_includes/body-main-aside.liquid \
    presentation/_includes/body-footer.liquid
```

The `body-main-aside.liquid` snippet includes the content under `body > main > aside` which is an optional right-hand column for wide displays. The `body-main-section.liquid` snippet includes the content under `body > main > section` which is the whole point of this exercise: the main `section` holds the display of Publications Index data, linking to Publications segments.

## using eleventy pagination to generate Publications segments

The eleventy static site generator generates HTML files from collections of `TemplateCollection` [[GitHub](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/blob/master/src/TemplateCollection.js)] (which are ultimately related to files, like markdown files) and from Pagination [üìñ [docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pages-from-data/#create-pages-from-data)] which, in this Studio, ultimately depends on Publications Index data in the `index.json` [file](./presentation/_data/index.json).

The `.presentation/segments` [folder](./presentation/segments) contains three hand-made pagination templates, rendering all of the `Document` information of the segments under the three top-level segments of the Publications Index data used in this sample. Although these templates are hand made, I remind myself that these templates could be generated by some Publications Activity written in C#. In the meantime, we can run this in bash to start the handiwork:

```bash
touch \
    presentation/segments/segment-00.html \
    presentation/segments/segment-01.html \
    presentation/segments/segment-02.html \
    presentation/segments/segment-base.html
```

where the `segment-??.html` files all depend on `segment-base.html` layout.
