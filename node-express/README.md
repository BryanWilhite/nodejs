# Express on Node.js

> [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Here in this sample we are going to step through [installation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) and the typical [hello-world](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) fun.

From an empty `node-express` [folder](../node-express):

```bash
npm init -y
npm i -s express
touch app.js
```

In `package.json` change `main`:

```json
"main": "app.js"
```
