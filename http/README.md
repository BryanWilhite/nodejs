# my introduction to node `http`

This minimalist introduction takes my years of experience with client-side JavaScript and applies it to node.js.

From this repository root folder, in Powershell, run

```PowerShell

node .\http\http.js

```

(or from the subdirectory of this sample run `npm start`).

And then navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) from the Run dialog.
