# elm minimal

This minimal sample is based on the [simple counter](http://elm-lang.org/examples/buttons) from “[An Introduction to Elm](https://www.gitbook.com/book/evancz/an-introduction-to-elm/details).”

From bash, we start with:

```bash

sudo npm install -g elm
sudo npm install -g elm-format

```

Then from [./elm-minimal](../elm-minimal) we run `elm-make`:

```bash

elm-make ./src/Counter.elm --output=./Counter.html

npm start

```

Conventionally, `package.json` has a non-life-cycle script command which changes the above commands to:

```bash

npm run make
npm start

```

The conventional [`elm-package.json`](./elm-package.json) is generated by `elm-make`.

The conventional [`/elm-stuff`](./elm-stuff) folder has been added to [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore).
