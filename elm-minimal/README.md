# elm minimal

This minimal sample is based on A Quick Sample under “[An Introduction to Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/).” This official guide features the use of [an online editor](https://elm-lang.org/examples/buttons) so what goes on here is now a divergence.

From an empty `elm-minimal` [folder](../elm-minimal), we start with:

```bash
npm init -y
npm i -D elm elm-format
mkdir src
touch src/Counter.elm
```

We copy the code from the official guide to the `Counter.elm` [file](./src/Counter.elm) and add this line to the top:

```elm
module Counter exposing (..)
```

Then we add these `npm` scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
    "elm:init": "elm init",
    "elm:make": "elm make ./src/Counter.elm --output=./Counter.html",
},
```

which allows us to run:

```console
npm run elm:init
npm run elm:make
```

The conventional [`elm.json`](./elm.json) is generated by `elm init`.

The conventional [`/elm-stuff`](./elm-stuff) folder has been added to [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore).
